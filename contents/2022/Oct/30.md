# This Week In Neovim updates

> Woh, a new section?! No, this is just an exceptional section that will spawn from time to time to provide you with some
> information about https://this-week-in-neovim.org itself.

This **TWiN #16** is a special weekly update, so I need to make a small announcment in your feed to ensure people read
this right away. I ([@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon)) took the time this week to update the Rust library I use to
parse the weekly updates (called `twin`). Next week, for **TWiN #17**, the contribution process changes a bit, following
the changes I introduced in `twin-0.2`. If you already contributed to TWiN or plan to, then you will probably want to
read [the following updated section on the
README](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents#structure-and-architecture). If not, jump directly to
[the next section](#neovim-core-updates)!

# [Neovim Core updates](#neovim-core-updates) {#neovim-core-updates}

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

    <span>An introduction and sample neovim configuration for Rust development in Lua</span>
  </a>
</h3>

This living blog post introduces piece by piece a sample Neovim configuration to
kickstart your configuration targeting Rust development. The blog was recently
updated to remove all VimL and uses Lua as its main configuration language.

The reader will learn how to setup
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) and install plugins such as [rust-tools.nvim](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim)
to take full advantage of the built-in LSP of neovim.
