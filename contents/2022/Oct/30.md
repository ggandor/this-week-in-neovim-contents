    <span>An introduction and sample neovim configuration for Rust development in Lua</span>
  </a>
</h3>

This living blog post introduces piece by piece a sample Neovim configuration to
kickstart your configuration targeting Rust development. The blog was recently
updated to remove all VimL and uses Lua as its main configuration language.

The reader will learn how to setup
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) and install plugins such as [rust-tools.nvim](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim)
to take full advantage of the built-in LSP of neovim.
